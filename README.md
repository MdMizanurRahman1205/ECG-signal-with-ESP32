# ECG-signal-with-ESP32
This Arduino sketch reads and monitors an ECG (Electrocardiogram) signal using an analog input pin (GPIO34) of an ESP32. It also checks for lead-off conditions (whether the ECG electrodes are properly attached to the body) using two digital input pins (GPIO12 and GPIO13).

AD8232 ECG sensor module or similar bio-potential measurement circuits with the ESP32.
